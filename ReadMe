This project is part of the implementation of 2019 Waters Challenge.
The processing power offered by GPUs and their capability to execute parallel    
workloads is exploited to execute and accelerate applications related to         
advanced driver assistance systems.                                              
                                                                                 
The challenge consists in analytically master the complex HW/SW system (that     
will be available as Amalthea model) to answer the following questions:          
                                                                                 
Response Time Computation:                                                       
 a) Given an application consisting of a set of dependent tasks and a given      
    mapping, calculate its end-to-end response time.                             
 b) The response time should account for the time for the copy engine to         
    transfer data between the CPU and the GPU.                                   
 c) The response time should account for the time for the data transfers between 
    the CPU and the shared main memory considering a read/execute/write semantic.
 d) Optionally the off-loading mechanism (synchronous/asynchronous) can be       
    changed to further optimize the end-to-end latencies.
